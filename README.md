## **Project Overview**

This project compiles popular quotes from popular characters on the American television show The Office. The project uses data from a pre-exisiting API and categorizes quotes by character and sorts them from featured, A-Z and Z-A.

## **Features**


## **Technologies Used**

## **Future Enhancements**
