## **Project Overview**

This project compiles popular quotes from popular characters on the American television show The Office. The project uses data from a pre-existing API and categorizes quotes by character. Users are also able to see a breakdown of the data in the form of a pie chart, search for quotes using keywords and sort from A-Z and Z-A.
