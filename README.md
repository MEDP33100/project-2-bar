## **Project Overview**

This project compiles popular quotes from popular characters on the American television show The Office. The project uses data from a pre-existing API and categorizes quotes by character. Users are also able to see a breakdown of the data in the form of a pie chart, search for quotes using keywords and sort from A-Z and Z-A. 

## **Features**

Some features used throughout the project include a sortation method for all quotes alphabetically and quotes from specific characters with their designated button to showcase.

## **Technologies Used**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- Express for server-side setup
- Handlebars
- Node.js
- [The Office Quotes API](https://officeapi.akashrajpurohit.com)
- Glitch

## **Future Enhancements**

- We would like to include the episode titles and air dates for each quote.
- Another future enhancement that can be added would be specific themes based on which character is picked to showcase the differences between them
- Find a way to optimize how the quotes are being rendered as there is a slight loading delay upon entering the website for the first time.
